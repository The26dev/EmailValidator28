# Security Updates Implementation

## Database Credentials Security

1. Created `.env.example` template file with secure configuration structure
2. Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential exposure
3. Updated `config.py` to use simplified environment variables
4. Removed hardcoded credentials from configuration files

## Next Steps

1. Update deployment documentation to include environment variable setup
2. Implement secrets rotation mechanism
3. Add validation for required environment variables
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with secure secrets management
