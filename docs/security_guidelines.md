# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the Email Validator Service.

## Authentication
### API Key Authentication
- All API requests must include an API key in the `X-API-Key` header
- API keys are generated using cryptographically secure methods
- Keys are stored as hashed values in the database
- Automatic key rotation every 90 days

### JWT Implementation
- Used for session management and stateless authentication
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days
- Contains encrypted user claims and permissions

## Authorization
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Available Roles:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - User: Basic validation operations
  - Analyst: Access to analytics and reports
- Each role has predefined permissions
- Permissions are verified on each request

### Permission Levels
```json
{
    "admin": {
        "validate": ["read", "write", "execute"],
        "users": ["read", "write", "delete"],
        "system": ["read", "configure"]
    },
    "user": {
        "validate": ["execute"],
        "results": ["read"]
    },
    "analyst": {
        "validate": ["read"],
        "analytics": ["read", "export"]
    }
}
```

## Data Protection
### PII Handling
- Email addresses are considered PII
- PII data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Encryption keys are managed through AWS KMS
- Data is automatically purged after retention period (30 days)

### Data Security Measures
1. Encryption at Rest
   - Database encryption using TDE
   - File system encryption for logs
   - Backup encryption using unique keys

2. Encryption in Transit
   - TLS 1.3 required for all connections
   - Strong cipher suites only
   - Certificate pinning for API clients

3. Key Management
   - Automated key rotation
   - Secure key storage in AWS KMS
   - Access audit logging for keys

## Security Best Practices
### Input Validation
- All inputs are validated against strict schemas
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- File upload restrictions and scanning

### Rate Limiting
- Per-endpoint rate limits
- Per-user quota management
- IP-based throttling
- Automatic blocking of suspicious activity

### Logging & Monitoring
- Security events logged to separate secure channel
- Real-time alert system for suspicious activities
- Regular security audit log review
- Incident response procedures documented

### Infrastructure Security
1. Network Security
   - VPC isolation
   - Security groups with minimal access
   - Regular security scans
   - DDoS protection

2. Application Security
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security headers configuration
   - CORS policy enforcement
   - CSP implementation

3. Operational Security
   - Secure CI/CD pipeline
   - Code signing
   - Regular security training
   - Incident response plan

## Compliance
### Data Retention
- Validation results: 30 days
- Audit logs: 1 year
- Access logs: 90 days
- Analytics data: Anonymized after 30 days

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data processing agreements available
- Privacy policy transparency

## Security Controls
### Technical Controls
- WAF configuration
- IDS/IPS systems
- File integrity monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning

### Administrative Controls
- Access review process
- Change management procedures
- Security training requirements
- Incident response plan

## Security Testing
### Regular Testing
- Weekly automated scans
- Monthly penetration testing
- Quarterly security review
- Annual third-party audit

### Security Response
- 24/7 security team
- Incident response procedures
- Vulnerability disclosure policy
- Bug bounty program
