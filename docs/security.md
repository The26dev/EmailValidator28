# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Email Validation System.

## Authentication
The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following security measures:
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens available for seamless re-authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key authentication for external services

### JWT Configuration
- Algorithm: HS256
- Token expiry: 24 hours
- Payload includes: user ID, roles, expiry timestamp
- Signed using environment-specific secret key

### API Key Authentication
- Required for external service access
- Keys stored securely in database
- Rate limiting applied per API key
- Regular key rotation recommended

## Data Protection
### Sensitive Data
- All credentials stored as environment variables
- Database credentials never exposed in code
- API keys managed through secure configuration
- Passwords hashed using secure algorithms

### Data in Transit
- All API endpoints use HTTPS
- JWT tokens transmitted securely
- API keys required in headers
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### Data Storage
- Credentials never stored in plain text
- Environment variables used for sensitive data
- Database access restricted by role
- Regular security audits performed

## Access Control
### Role-Based Access
- Admin: Full system access
- Validator: Email validation only
- Reporter: Analytics access only
- Basic: Limited functionality

### Request Validation
- Input sanitization on all endpoints
- Request size limits enforced
- Content-type verification
- Origin validation

## Security Best Practices
### Implementation
1. Use environment variables for credentials
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Validate all inputs
4. Log security events
5. Regular dependency updates

### Monitoring
1. Track failed authentication attempts
2. Monitor API usage patterns
3. Alert on suspicious activity
4. Regular security audits

### Maintenance
1. Regular security patches
2. Dependency updates
3. Access review
4. Security training

## Development Guidelines
### Code Security
1. No hardcoded credentials
2. Input validation required
3. Use prepared statements
4. Implement error handling

### Testing Requirements
1. Security test cases
2. Penetration testing
3. Dependency scanning
4. Regular audits
