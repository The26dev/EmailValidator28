# Monitoring System Overview

## Components

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - StatsD integration for metric recording
   - Configurable through environment variables
   - Automatic error handling and logging
   
2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - API latency tracking
   - Validation performance metrics
   - System resource utilization monitoring
   
3. **Error Tracking**
   - Detailed error context collection
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Error type categorization
   
4. **Cache Monitoring**
   - Hit/miss ratios
   - Cache size tracking
   - Performance metrics
   
5. **System Health**
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Service uptime monitoring
   - Database connection health

## Error Handling

All metric recording operations include:
- Graceful handling of StatsD client failures
- Detailed error logging with context
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations

## Best Practices

1. **Metric Naming**
   - Use consistent naming patterns
   - Include relevant context in tags
   - Keep names descriptive but concise
   
2. **Error Handling**
   - Always wrap metric operations in try/except
   - Log failures with appropriate context
   - Prevent metric failures from affecting core service
   
3. **Performance**
   - Use batching where appropriate
   - Monitor metric collection overhead
   - Configure appropriate sampling rates

## Integration Guidelines

1. Import appropriate tracking functions from metrics.py
2. Use context managers for timing operations
3. Include relevant tags for better metric segmentation
4. Handle potential failures appropriately
